TAP Assessment for URL Shortener

https://baby-url-maker.herokuapp.com/

In the coded example, due to not deploying to the cloud, the URL shortener is not able to utilize the purely short links for usage. Ideally, we would want to deploy a server to the cloud to listen to traffic with a domain name so that we are able to listen to traffic when the shortened links are used, thus redirecting the user whenever they click the shortened user even from outside the website of the shortener. However, due to the time constraints, the shortener as of now works by creating a shortened URL from a copied version of the full URL with a link that the user can click to access the full URL. Future works would include creating list of previous links, deleting created links and having access to all created links.
